# G-Search MCP

A containerized version of "G-Search MCP"

> Repository: [jae-jae/g-search-mcp](https://github.com/jae-jae/g-search-mcp)

## Description

A powerful MCP server for Google search that enables parallel searching with multiple keywords simultaneously.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--jae-jae--g-search-mcp--g-search-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--jae-jae--g-search-mcp--g-search-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
