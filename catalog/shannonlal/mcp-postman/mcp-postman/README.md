# Postman MCP Server

A containerized version of "Postman MCP Server"

> Repository: [shannonlal/mcp-postman](https://github.com/shannonlal/mcp-postman)

## Description

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables running Postman collections using Newman. This server allows LLMs to execute API tests and get detailed results through a standardized interface.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--shannonlal--mcp-postman--mcp-postman
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--shannonlal--mcp-postman--mcp-postman 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
