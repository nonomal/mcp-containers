# Hacker News MCP Server

A containerized version of "Hacker News MCP Server"

> Repository: [erithwik/mcp-hn](https://github.com/erithwik/mcp-hn)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for fetching information from Hacker News.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--erithwik--mcp-hn--mcp-hn
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--erithwik--mcp-hn--mcp-hn 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
