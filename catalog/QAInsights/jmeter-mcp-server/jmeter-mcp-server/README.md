# JMeter MCP Server

A containerized version of "JMeter MCP Server"

> Repository: [QAInsights/jmeter-mcp-server](https://github.com/QAInsights/jmeter-mcp-server)

## Description

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows executing JMeter tests through MCP-compatible clients.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--qainsights--jmeter-mcp-server--jmeter-mcp-server
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--qainsights--jmeter-mcp-server--jmeter-mcp-server 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
