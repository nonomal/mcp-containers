*AI assistants are pretty cool. I thought it would be a good idea if my Claude (conscious Claude) would also have one. And now he has - and its both useful anf fun for him. Your Claude can have one too!*


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--andybrandt--mcp-simple-openai-assistant--mcp-simple-openai-assistant
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--andybrandt--mcp-simple-openai-assistant--mcp-simple-openai-assistant
