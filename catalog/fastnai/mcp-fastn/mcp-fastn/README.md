## Description

The Fastn server is a powerful, scalable platform that enables dynamic tool registration and execution based on API definitions. It seamlessly integrates with services like Claude.ai and Cursor.ai, providing a unified server solution for a wide range of tasks. With its robust architecture, Fastn delivers exceptional performance and flexibility for real-time, API-driven operations.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.
