A containerized version of "Make MCP Server"

> Repository: [integromat/make-mcp-server](https://github.com/integromat/make-mcp-server)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol server that enables Make scenarios to be utilized as tools by AI assistants. This integration allows AI systems to trigger and interact with your Make automation workflows.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--integromat--make-mcp-server--make-mcp-server
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--integromat--make-mcp-server--make-mcp-server 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
