# Deepseek Thinker MCP Server

A containerized version of "Deepseek Thinker MCP Server"

> Repository: [ruixingshi/deepseek-thinker-mcp](https://github.com/ruixingshi/deepseek-thinker-mcp)

## Description

A MCP (Model Context Protocol) provider Deepseek reasoning content to MCP-enabled AI Clients, like Claude Desktop. Supports access to Deepseek's thought processes from the Deepseek API service or from a local Ollama server.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--ruixingshi--deepseek-thinker-mcp--deepseek-thinker-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--ruixingshi--deepseek-thinker-mcp--deepseek-thinker-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.

#### Environment Variables
