# iterm-mcp

A containerized version of "iterm-mcp"

> Repository: [ferrislucas/iterm-mcp](https://github.com/ferrislucas/iterm-mcp)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol server that provides access to your iTerm session.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--ferrislucas--iterm-mcp--iterm-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--ferrislucas--iterm-mcp--iterm-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
