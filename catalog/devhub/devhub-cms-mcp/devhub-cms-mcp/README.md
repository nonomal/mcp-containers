A containerized version of "DevHub CMS MCP"

> Repository: [devhub/devhub-cms-mcp](https://github.com/devhub/devhub-cms-mcp)

## Description

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) integration for managing content in the [DevHub CMS system](https://www.devhub.com/).


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--devhub--devhub-cms-mcp--devhub-cms-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \ 
-e DEVHUB_API_KEY=devhub-api-key -e DEVHUB_API_SECRET=devhub-api-secret -e DEVHUB_BASE_URL=devhub-base-url \
ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--devhub--devhub-cms-mcp--devhub-cms-mcp  "devhub-cms-mcp"
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-i` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.

#### Environment Variables

- `DEVHUB_API_KEY`
