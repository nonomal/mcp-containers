# FirstCycling MCP Server

A containerized version of "FirstCycling MCP Server"

> Repository: [r-huijts/firstcycling-mcp](https://github.com/r-huijts/firstcycling-mcp)

## Description

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides professional cycling data from FirstCycling. It allows you to retrieve comprehensive information about professional cyclists, race results, race details, and historical cycling data.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--r-huijts--firstcycling-mcp--firstcycling-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--r-huijts--firstcycling-mcp--firstcycling-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
