# mcp-scholarly MCP server

A containerized version of "mcp-scholarly MCP server"

> Repository: [adityak74/mcp-scholarly](https://github.com/adityak74/mcp-scholarly)

## Description

A MCP server to search for accurate academic articles. More scholarly vendors will be added soon.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--adityak74--mcp-scholarly--mcp-scholarly
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--adityak74--mcp-scholarly--mcp-scholarly 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
