A containerized version of "Yahoo Finance MCP Server"

> Repository: [narumiruna/yfinance-mcp](https://github.com/narumiruna/yfinance-mcp)

## Description

A simple MCP server for Yahoo Finance using yfinance. This server provides a set of tools to fetch stock data, news, and other financial information.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--narumiruna--yfinance-mcp--yfinance-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--narumiruna--yfinance-mcp--yfinance-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
