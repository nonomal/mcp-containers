# Scrapling Fetch MCP

A containerized version of "Scrapling Fetch MCP"

> Repository: [cyberchitta/scrapling-fetch-mcp](https://github.com/cyberchitta/scrapling-fetch-mcp)

## Description

An MCP server that helps AI assistants access text content from websites that implement bot detection, bridging the gap between what you can see in your browser and what the AI can access.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--cyberchitta--scrapling-fetch-mcp--scrapling-fetch-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--cyberchitta--scrapling-fetch-mcp--scrapling-fetch-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
