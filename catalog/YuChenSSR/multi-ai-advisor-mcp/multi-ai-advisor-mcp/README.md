# Multi-Model Advisor

A containerized version of "Multi-Model Advisor"

> Repository: [YuChenSSR/multi-ai-advisor-mcp](https://github.com/YuChenSSR/multi-ai-advisor-mcp)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that queries multiple Ollama models and combines their responses, providing diverse AI perspectives on a single question.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--yuchenssr--multi-ai-advisor-mcp--multi-ai-advisor-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--yuchenssr--multi-ai-advisor-mcp--multi-ai-advisor-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
