# Neovim MCP Server

A containerized version of "Neovim MCP Server"

> Repository: [bigcodegen/mcp-neovim-server](https://github.com/bigcodegen/mcp-neovim-server)

## Description

A proof of concept integration between Claude Desktop (or any client) and Neovim using Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the official neovim/node-client JavaScript library. This server leverages Vim's native text editing commands and workflows, which Claude already understands, to create a lightweight code or general purpose AI text assistance layer.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--bigcodegen--mcp-neovim-server--mcp-neovim-server
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--bigcodegen--mcp-neovim-server--mcp-neovim-server 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.


### Configuration

The container supports the following configuration options:




#### Environment Variables

- `ALLOW_SHELL_COMMANDS`
- `NVIM_SOCKET_PATH`
