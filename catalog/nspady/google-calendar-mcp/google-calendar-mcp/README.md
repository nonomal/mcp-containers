# Google Calendar MCP Server

A containerized version of "Google Calendar MCP Server"

> Repository: [nspady/google-calendar-mcp](https://github.com/nspady/google-calendar-mcp)

## Description

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides integration with Google Calendar. It allows LLMs to read, create, update and search for calendar events through a standardized interface.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--nspady--google-calendar-mcp--google-calendar-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \ 
ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--nspady--google-calendar-mcp--google-calendar-mcp  "bun run start"
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-i` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
