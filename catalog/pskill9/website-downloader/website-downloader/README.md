# Website Downloader MCP Server

A containerized version of "Website Downloader MCP Server"

> Repository: [pskill9/website-downloader](https://github.com/pskill9/website-downloader)

## Description

This MCP server provides a tool to download entire websites using wget. It preserves the website structure and converts links to work locally.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--pskill9--website-downloader--website-downloader
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--pskill9--website-downloader--website-downloader 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
