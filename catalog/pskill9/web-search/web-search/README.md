# Web Search MCP Server

A containerized version of "Web Search MCP Server"

> Repository: [pskill9/web-search](https://github.com/pskill9/web-search)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables free web searching using Google search results, with no API keys required.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--pskill9--web-search--web-search
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--pskill9--web-search--web-search 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
