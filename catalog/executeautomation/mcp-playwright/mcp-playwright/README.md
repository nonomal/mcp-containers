# Playwright MCP Server 🎭

A containerized version of "Playwright MCP Server 🎭"

> Repository: [executeautomation/mcp-playwright](https://github.com/executeautomation/mcp-playwright)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol server that provides browser automation capabilities using Playwright. This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages, take screenshots, generate test code, web scraps the page and execute JavaScript in a real browser environment.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--executeautomation--mcp-playwright--mcp-playwright
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--executeautomation--mcp-playwright--mcp-playwright 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
