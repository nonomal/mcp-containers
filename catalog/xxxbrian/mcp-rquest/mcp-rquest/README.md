# mcp-rquest

A containerized version of "mcp-rquest"

> Repository: [xxxbrian/mcp-rquest](https://github.com/xxxbrian/mcp-rquest)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides advanced HTTP request capabilities for Claude and other LLMs. Built on [rquest](https://github.com/0x676e67/rquest), this server enables realistic browser emulation with accurate TLS/JA3/JA4 fingerprints, allowing models to interact with websites more naturally and bypass common anti-bot measures. It also supports converting PDF and HTML documents to Markdown for easier processing by LLMs.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--xxxbrian--mcp-rquest--mcp-rquest
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--xxxbrian--mcp-rquest--mcp-rquest 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
