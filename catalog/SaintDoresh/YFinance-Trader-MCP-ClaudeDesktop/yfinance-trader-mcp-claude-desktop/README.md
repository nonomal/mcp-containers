## Description

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool that provides stock market data and trading capabilities using the yfinance library, specifically adapted for Claude Desktop.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--saintdoresh--yfinance-trader-mcp-claudedesktop--yfinance-trader-mcp-claude-desktop
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--saintdoresh--yfinance-trader-mcp-claudedesktop--yfinance-trader-mcp-claude-desktop 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
